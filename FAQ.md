# Frequently Asked Questions

> **I have a Wii U on X.X.X firmware. What can I/ should do with it?**

Update the Wii U to 5.5.1 if it isn't already. The eventual release of the IOSU exploit will be compatible with this firmware, and when Nintendo does release a new firmware - it might be tricky to get to 5.5.1 if you're on a lower firmware. Not a lot of retail discs are known to provide the specific 5.5.1 update, so update via Nintendo's official servers **now** while you can. If you don't believe me, check out these statements from [WulfyStylez](https://gbatemp.net/threads/wii-u-hacking-homebrew-discussion.367489/page-993#post-6601905), [(1)](https://gbatemp.net/threads/wii-u-hacking-homebrew-discussion.367489/page-994#post-6604507) and [shinyquagsire23](https://gbatemp.net/threads/wii-u-hacking-homebrew-discussion.367489/page-993#post-6602696) of Team SALT over on GBATemp.

> **What is Homebrew Launcher?**

* Homebrew Launcher finds & allows you to boot different Wii U homebrew apps like Loadiine or nnupatcher.

> **What is loadiine?**

* Loadiine gx2 is a backup loader for the Wii U. You can play digital backups of your games through your SD card.

> **Can we use external USB Hard Drives to load backups?**

* You can load games via USB when you install games via the **Brazilian Title Install Method**, though you can't load games through USB via loadiine.

> **When are we getting an IOSU exploit?**

* We have one! Unfortunately, it's useless until developers start taking advantage of the new functions this new exploit brings. Team SALT is working on there own IOSU exploit with a suite of tools to be released. We have no ETA on it's release, however, please be patient and send positive support in their direction. There are others working in the background as well, though we don't specifically know who is. Smealum did a write up/ released tools for developers on his [IOSUhax research](https://github.com/smealum/iosuhax), naehrwert [put out a write up](https://nwert.wordpress.com/2016/05/03/ioctlvhax/) on how he and Plutoo found an IOSU bug back in September 2015 for possible hacks.

> **What kind of SD card can I use?**

* Anything up to 256gb will work. Class 10 SD cards will be fine. Even micro SD cards in SD adapters are good to go.

> **Can I play EU backups on US consoles and vice versa?**

* Via loadiine, yes. Loadiine is region free, you're good to go! Though - you may have to edit some files to make things work correctly. For example, something named like 'musicEU.mtv' may need to be changed to 'musicUS.mtv' and so on. (Not all games are like this.)

> **XXXXX game won't work/ run correctly in Loadiine. How do I make it work?**

* Some games will just function as is, others work with weird bugs, and others won't boot and will require a bit of work to get running. (Some games will just straight up not work.) Before asking in the subreddit, try checking the [GBATemp Loadiine Compatibility Wiki](http://wiki.gbatemp.net/wiki/Loadiine_compatibility_list) first. You might find your answer there! 

> **Can I play backups (games) online?**

* You can play online when you install games via the [Brazilian Title Install Method](https://github.com/FlimFlam69/WiiUTutorial/blob/master/ABrazilianWaysToDoThings.md), though you can't play games online via loadiine.

> **I keep seeing 'FSGetMountSource failed.' after I run the exploit. What went wrong?**

* Most of the time (if not *all* of the time) you either don't have an SD Card in the Wii U, or you've setup the file structure on your SD card incorrectly. Go back to, '*Kernel Exploit Prep Work: Setting up Your SD Card*' near the top of the guide and double check everything.

> ***Nintendo scheduled maintenance for this time. Does that mean we're getting an update?**

* Consider that Nintendo does this every week. Just because they're doing maintenance, doesn't mean we're getting an update. However, they *have* released updates in this fashion before, more traditionally with 3DS. No one can tell you when an update will be pushed, but as long as you've taken precautions (Dualhax, self-host offline, etc) - you should be fine. 

> **My Wii U says it failed to download something/ a system update. Is there one out?**

* No, this means Dualhax is working. The Wii U may think it's trying to update, but in reality it's unsure because it can't talk to Nintendo's servers. 

> **How do I mod Super Smash Bros. for Wii U?**

* I'm not going to do any kind of write-ups on this because it doesn't interest me that much. However, someone put together a smash modder's dream website. Check out [Sma4sh Mods!](http://sm4shmods.com/) It's got everything you need to get started (like tutorials).

> **How do I mod Splatoon?**

* Again - I don't really care too much about modding, so I don't plan on doing any write-ups. GBATemp has a bunch of threads about it, and I'm sure other people in /r/wiiuhacks will be able to help you out.
