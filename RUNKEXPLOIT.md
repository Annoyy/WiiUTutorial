# **Preparing & Running the Kernel Exploit**

## **[Kernel Exploit Prep Work: *Setting up Your SD Card*]**

**Step 1)** [Format your SD card to FAT32.](http://www.wikihow.com/Format-an-SD-Card) If the linked method doesn't work for your OS (or if FAT32 isn't listed as an option), you need additional software. /u/LightPrism suggests [fat32format.](http://www.ridgecrop.demon.co.uk/index.htm?guiformat.htm)

* **Note:** If you can, use 64kb clusters. If that ends up not working, try 32kb clusters. I've gotten them both working on Wii U, but people seem to be saying they have better luck with 64kb clusters.

* **Note 2:** If you have to name your SD card, do not name it "wiiu". It's been reported that this will **not** work for whatever reason. (Thanks /u/unfortunate_timing, I should've added this tidbit a while ago!)

**Step 2)** Download my [Starter Pack](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzJAGHWBJ_5saVNnMXhzTkVhR2s)

**Step 3)** Extract the contents of the .zip file to the root of your SD Card (It only should be a wiiu folder).

**Step 4)** Games go into the following directory:

* SD:/wiiu/games/Example Game [GAMEID]

## **[Running the Kernel Exploit: *The Easy Way*]**

**Step 1)** Put the SD card into the SD Card slot in your Wii U

**Step 2)** Turn on your Wii U, and go to the Web Browser.

**Step 3)** Go into your internet settings and *Reset your Data.* (If this isn't your first time running the exploit, you can probably get a way with just *Deleting Cookies*.)

**Step 4)** Back out of internet settings and type this into the address bar: http://loadiine.ovh/ 

* **Optional:** Bookmark this address so you don't have to type this in *every time* you want to run this exploit in the future.

**Step 5)** Ensure that the displayed drop down box is displaying "Homebrew Launcher..." and press the **Submit** button.

**Step 6)** Presto! It should have worked, and you should be seeing the Homebrew Launcher menu within seconds. If it freezes on a white screen, then just do a hard reset and go back to **Step 2**.

I hope this helps! It's a pretty simple process. The exploit isn't 100% stable, so it might fail from time to time.

## **[Running the Kernel Exploit: *The Self-Hosting Way*]**

* *This guide is written for Windows Operating Systems.*

With this method, you will be self-hosting the Wii U exploit, rather than going to loadiine.ovh every time you want to get into Homebrew Launcher. This is literally using *the same payload* http:/loadiine.ovh uses to exploit your console online, so you should be getting close to a 100% success rate with this.

I have made a package for everyone to download that includes instructions on how to do everything. I've made it as simple and noob friendly as possible, though the guide assumes you have followed the "*Kernel Exploit Prep Work: Setting up Your SD Card*" guide from above. You can download the package below.

**Note:** This is a modified version of [Kafluke's all-in-one package from GBATemp](http://gbatemp.net/threads/5-5-1-5-4-0-5-3-2-self-hosting-package-everything-in-one-zip-file.424679/). Special thanks to Cybernatus (From GBATemp and loadiine.ovh) for making this payload public.

## **[Running the Kernel Exploit: *Self-Hosting and Taking Your Wii U Offline*]**

* *This guide is written for Windows Operating Systems.*

With this method, your Wii U will be completely offline and still be able to access the exploit. This is literally using *the same payload* loadiine.ovh uses to exploit your console online, so you should be getting close to a 100% success rate with this. It will be impossible for Nintendo to update your console, but you will obviously lose the ability to browse the eShop and play games online.

Special thanks to Cybernatus (From GBATemp and loadiine.ovh) for making this payload public.
