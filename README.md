# FlimFlam69's 5.5.1 Kernel Exploit Guide

**LATEST FIRMWARE:** 5.5.1  //  **LATEST EXPLOITABLE FIRMWARE:** 5.5.1  //  **RECOMMENDED FIRMWARE:** 5.5.1


Your Wii U is in no danger if you decide to run an exploit. This is a very safe procedure, and a relatively simple one at that. Were not soldering anything, or preforming kind of hardware mods; all you need is your **computer**, the **internet** (with a wireless router), a **Wii U**, and an **SD card**.

If you have any other questions, check the [F.A.Q.](https://github.com/FlimFlam69/WiiUTutorial/blob/master/FAQ.md) first before you ask! I will try my best to answer any questions.

### 1) [Blocking Updates From Nintendo](https://github.com/FlimFlam69/WiiUTutorial/blob/master/BlockingUpdates.md)
  
Before we get started exploiting the Wii U, we should set the console up to block updates from Nintendo. If your Wii U goes above the latest firmware (5.5.1), you may lose your ability to get to the homebrew launcher and all the other fun stuff. This part of the guide contains the following sections:
  
* Dualhax (Tubehax + Chncdcksn hax)
* Router URL Blocking
* Disable Automatic Software Downloads

### 2) [Preparing & Running the Kernel Exploit](https://github.com/FlimFlam69/WiiUTutorial/blob/master/RUNKEXPLOIT.md)

This is where the fun begins! In this section, we'll be setting up the SD card so we can run the kernel exploit. There are a couple way to go about doing this and we'll explore some of those options. This part of the guide contains the following sections:
  
* **Kernel Exploit Prep Work:** *Setting up Your SD Card* 
* **Running the Kernel Exploit:** *The Easy Way* 
* **Running the Kernel Exploit:** *The Self-Hosting Way* 
* **Running the Kernel Exploit:** *Self-Hosting and Taking Your Wii U Offline* 

### 3) [Brazillian Title Install Method](https://github.com/FlimFlam69/WiiUTutorial/blob/master/ABrazilianWaysToDoThings.md)

This is an alternative to loadiine. In a nutshell, we will be installing any game of your choosing to the Wii U itself. This means that if you have an external USB HDD formatted to the Wii U's file format, then you will be able to install whatever game to that USB drive and run it. Going online with these titles **will** work.

**Disclaimer:** /r/WiiUHacks does not condone piracy. In this section I will be presenting tools that access Nintendo's servers to download titles in the desired format for this tutorial. This same method displayed can be used to download content illegally; which we are in no way responsible for your actions regardless of what you chose to do.

This part of the guide contains the following sections:

   * **Phase 1:** uTikDownloadHelper
   * **Phase 2:** Formatting the USB HDD
   * **Phase 3:** Setting up the SD card and Installing our Game
   * Additional Notes
