# Blocking Updates From Nintendo

## **[Dual hax (Tubehax + Chncdcksn hax)]**

Tubehax & chncdcksn hax are two different DNS servers that are used for the purpose of preventing updates through Nintendo. Before we do anything, we need to make sure that your Wii U will remain on 5.5.1 - and this is one of the best/ most popular ways of doing so while still being connected online.

This method sets up both *'Tubehax'* and *'chncdcksn hax'* DNS servers. In the event that Tubehax goes down, the Wii U will automatically use chncdcksn hax instead. (You will not be able to access the eShop through this. If you want eShop access, check out the Various Things section.)

* Turn Auto-Obtain DNS **OFF**
* Set Primary DNS to **107.211.140.065** (*Tubehax*)
* Set Secondary DNS to **104.236.072.203** (*chncdcksn hax*)

**Note:** If you still want YouTube access on your Wii U, set Tubehax as your 'Secondary DNS' and chncdcksn hax as your 'Primary DNS'.

Thanks to /u/chncdcksn for the DNS server. The community absolutely appreciates it!

## **[Router URL Blocking]**

If your router has the option to block certain URLs from passing through, that's a way better way of keeping your Wii U safe and connected. After setting this up, I *don't think* you will be able to access the eShop, but you should be able to play games online just fine. (*If you still want eShop access, check out the Various Things section.*) I can't exactly write a guide URL router blocking because everyone's router is different, and more specifically, my router doesn't have that specific function. Here are the URLs to block if you can:

* nus.cdn.c.shop.nintendowifi.net
* nus.cdn.shop.wii.com
* nus.cdn.wup.shop.nintendo.net
* nus.wup.shop.nintendo.net
* nus.c.shop.nintendowifi.net
* c.shop.nintendowifi.net
* cbvc.cdn.nintendo.net
* cbvc.nintendo.net

**Note:** Router URL Blocking will block all things Nintendo. This means that if you have a 3DS of any kind, it will not be able to preform updates either. Other Wii U consoles connected to that router won't be able to update as well.

## **[Disable Automatic Software Downloads]**

As an added precaution, you can also do as the header says: disable automatic software downloads. If you go into internet settings, the option to enable/ disable is below the 'View Mac Address' button. (Thanks /u/KingGhidorah01)

* **Note:** Do NOT use this as a substitute for Tubehax, chncdcksn hax, or Router URL Blocking. This is only something you should do IN ADDITION to Tubehax, chncdcksn hax, or Router URL Blocking.
